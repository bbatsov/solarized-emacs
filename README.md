# Solarized for Emacs

Solarized for Emacs is an Emacs port of the [Solarized theme for vim](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized),
developed by Ethan Schoonover.

You can find several screenshots of Solarized for Emacs [here](https://emacsthemes.com/themes/solarized-themes.html).

Solarized for Emacs is tested only under Emacs 24, but should be
working under Emacs 23 as well. The theme is implemented in terms of
customizations and `deftheme` and does not require the
`color-theme-package`.

## Installation

Solarized for Emacs is available for installation via the
[MELPA](http://melpa.org) using `package.el`.  Assuming you've set it
up you can install Solarized like this:

`M-x package-install solarized-theme`

This package will install two variants of the theme; `solarized-light-theme`
and `solarized-dark-theme`. You can load one of the theme variants with `M-x
load-theme`.

To load it automatically on Emacs startup add this to your init file:

```el
(load-theme 'solarized-light t)
```

or

```el
(load-theme 'solarized-dark t)
```

(If you want to install manually that procedure is briefly documented in the
FAQ at the end of this document.)

## Customisations

### Theme specific settings

If you don't like low-contrast modeline or fringe, you can `customize` them
either by doing `M-x customize-group solarized` or setting the values using
elisp code:

```el
;; make the fringe stand out from the background
(setq solarized-distinct-fringe-background t)

;; Don't change the font for some headings and titles
(setq solarized-use-variable-pitch nil)

;; make the modeline high contrast
(setq solarized-high-contrast-mode-line t)

;; Use less bolding
(setq solarized-use-less-bold t)

;; Use more italics
(setq solarized-use-more-italic t)

;; Use less colors for indicators such as git:gutter, flycheck and similar
(setq solarized-emphasize-indicators nil)

;; Don't change size of org-mode headlines (but keep other size-changes)
(setq solarized-scale-org-headlines nil)

;; Avoid all font-size changes
(setq solarized-height-minus-1 1.0)
(setq solarized-height-plus-1 1.0)
(setq solarized-height-plus-2 1.0)
(setq solarized-height-plus-3 1.0)
(setq solarized-height-plus-4 1.0)

```

Note that these need to be set **before** `load-theme` is invoked for Solarized.

### Underline position setting for X

If you are using Emacs under X you might like the following setting which puts
the underline below the
[font bottomline instead of the baseline](https://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/pseries/v5r3/topic/com.ibm.aix.graPHIGS/doc/phigstrf/figures/afma5rbd.jpg).

Imho it enhances the general readability and also it fits well with the default
`solarized-high-contrast-mode-line` setting which uses an slightly emphazised
underline for the modeline to create one horizontal window border in the same
manner as the vertical border.

```el
(setq x-underline-at-descent-line t)
```

## Create theme using color palette
The Solarized Face settings consist of a palette of colors with eight
accents in addition to the darkest and brightest colors. Recent
changes allow you to freely create theme files using different
palettes instead of the Solarized color palette.  It consists of two
steps: **creating a theme file** and **loading a theme**.

### Creating/Loading Theme Files
Select the darkest and lightest colors and the eight accents to pass
to the function. This creates a theme file in `.emacs.d/themes/`. If
you need to make minor modifications, you can override Face
individually by specifying a free Sexp as the fourth argument.

Once you have a theme file, you can load it with load-theme, like
solarized.

```el
;; inspired vim's jellybeans color-theme
(solarized-create-theme-file-with-palette 'light 'solarized-jellybeans-light
  '("#202020" "#ffffff"
    "#ffb964" "#8fbfdc" "#a04040" "#b05080" "#805090" "#fad08a" "#99ad6a" "#8fbfdc"))

(load-theme 'solarized-jellybeans-light t)
```

```el
;; inspired emacs's mesa color-theme
(solarized-create-theme-file-with-palette 'light 'solarized-mesa-light
  '("#000000" "#faf5ee"
    "#3388dd" "#ac3d1a" "#dd2222" "#8b008b" "#00b7f0" "#1388a2" "#104e8b" "#00688b"))

(load-theme 'solarized-mesa-light t)
```

```el
;; inspired emacs's solarized color-theme
(solarized-create-theme-file-with-palette 'light 'solarized-solarized-light
  '("#002b36" "#fdf6e3"
    "#b58900" "#cb4b16" "#dc322f" "#d33682" "#6c71c4" "#268bd2" "#2aa198" "#859900"))

(load-theme 'solarized-solarized-light t)
```

```el
;; wombat color-theme with misc face definition
(solarized-create-theme-file-with-palette 'dark 'solarized-wombat-dark
  '("#2a2a29" "#f6f3e8"
    "#e5c06d" "#ddaa6f" "#ffb4ac" "#e5786d" "#834c98" "#a4b5e6" "#7ec98f" "#8ac6f2")
  '((custom-theme-set-faces
     theme-name
     `(default ((,class (:foreground ,(solarized-color-blend base03 base3 0.15 2) :background ,base03))))
     `(highlight ((,class (:background ,violet))))
     `(font-lock-builtin-face ((,class (:foreground ,magenta))))
     `(font-lock-constant-face ((,class (:foreground ,blue))))
     `(font-lock-comment-face ((,class (:foreground ,base00))))
     `(mode-line
       ((,class (:foreground ,base2 :background ,(solarized-color-blend base03 base3 0.85 2)))))
     `(mode-line-inactive
       ((,class (:foreground ,base00 :background ,(solarized-color-blend base03 "black" 0.85 2)))))
     `(mode-line-buffer-id ((,class (:foreground ,base3 :weight bold))))
     `(minibuffer-prompt ((,class (:foreground ,base1))))
     `(vertical-border ((,class (:foreground ,base03)))))))

(load-theme 'solarized-wombat-dark t)
```

### Caution
If the theme file already exists, `solorized-create-theme-file` does not
regenerate the file. If the file exists, it can be overwritten by
setting the fifth argument to `t`.

## Bugs & Improvements

Please, report any problems that you find on the projects integrated
issue tracker. If you've added some improvements and you want them
included upstream don't hesitate to send me a patch or even better - a
GitHub pull request.

## FAQ

### Stand-alone manual installation

Save the following files in a folder that's on your Emacs' `load-path`:

* [dash.el](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magnars/dash.el/master/dash.el) - [dash](https://github.com/magnars/dash.el), a modern list library for Emacs
* [solarized.el](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bbatsov/solarized-emacs/master/solarized.el) - the solarized theme

Save the following files into `~/.emacs.d/themes`:

* [solarized-light-theme.el](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bbatsov/solarized-emacs/master/solarized-light-theme.el)
* [solarized-dark-theme.el](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bbatsov/solarized-emacs/master/solarized-dark-theme.el)

Add this your `.emacs` init file:

```el
(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/themes")
```

Now you can load the theme with the interactive function `load-theme`.
