# Prelude

Solarized for Emacs is an Emacs port of the [Solarized theme for vim](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized),
developed by Ethan Schoonover.

Solarized for Emacs is tested only under Emacs 24, but should be
working under Emacs 23 as well. The theme is implemented in terms of
customizations and `deftheme` and does not require the
`color-theme-package`.

# Installation

## Stand-alone installation

Download `solarized.el`, `solarized-dark-theme.el` and
`solarized-light-theme.el`.

Place `solarized.el` is a folder that's on your Emacs' `load-path`.
Afterward place `solarized-dark-theme.el` and
`solarized-light-theme.el` in `~/.emacs.d/themes` (or some other
folder if you prefer so). Add this your
`.emacs.d`:

`(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/themes")`

Now you can load the theme with the interactive function `load-theme`.

## MELPA & Marmalade

Solarized for Emacs is available for installation via the
[MELPA](http://melpa.milkbox.net) and
[Marmalade](http://marmalade-repo.org/) `package.el`
repositories. Assuming you've set one of the them up (I recommend
MELPA) you can install solarized like this:

`M-x package-install solarized-theme`

Afterwards - business as usual, just load one of the theme variants
with `M-x load-theme`.

# Customisations

If you don't like low-contrast modeline or fringe, you can `customize` them:

```emacs
;; make the fringe stand out from the background
(setq solarized-distinct-fringe-background t)

;; make the modeline high contrast
(setq solarized-high-contrast-mode-line t)
```

Note that these need to be set **before** `load-theme` is invoked for Solarized.
